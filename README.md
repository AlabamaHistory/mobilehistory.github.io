        <p>Today I played with my cousins. We played with water ballons at first. Then, we got out a sprinkler and went down the slide while it was wet. After that we went and played some bord games. Then they left and I played Fortinte. Yes I play Fortinte. What, I like it. It is a good game. <a href = 'https://webcoder54.github.io/'>Get on my freind's website.</a> See he does too.
