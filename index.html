        <h2 id='emh'>Early Mobile History </h2>
        <p>Spanish explorers dicovered Mobile in the 1500s. At first the Spanish called Mobile Bay the
Bay of the Holy Spirit. Mobile was discovered only 27 years after America was found by Christopher
	 Columbus. Admiral Alvarez de Pineda became the first European to sail into Mobile Bay in 1516. It would 
		  take 20 years for a European to step in today's Alabama! </p>
			<p> <br>In beetween 1539 and 1541 explorer, 
	Hernando De Soto, explored and, defeated the Indian city, Mauvila, which is were today's Mobile get's its name.
 The battle was against Chief Tuskaloosa and his people. They were stationed north of today's Mobile. Tuskaloosa 
   was not killed or captured but almost everyone who lived in Mauvila was killed. Then, Trist√°n de Luna y Arellano and his
				 crew landed in Mobile Bay in 1559 then a hurricane came and it destroyed their colony and their 
					ships. </p>
					<p> <br>A french man named Pierre
					 Le Moyne and his men were the first europeans
					  to to make a mark on Mobile.In the late 1600s, the french goverment was trying to make some
					   settlementsand claim the mouth of the Mississippi River. When the Spanish leared the 
					   french's plan they quickly went and cliamed the Pensacola Bay. After Iberville's first trip
					   the French sent him agian and he made warehouses and port faculties on today's Dauphin Island
					   . They did this because of how deep the water is. </p>
